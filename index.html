                    <hr>
                    <p>MERN stack development is a popular web development framework that comprises four essential
                        technologies: <b> MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.</b>
                        <br>
                        <b>MongoDB</b>: It's a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, making it
                        suitable for handling diverse data types.
                        <br>
                        <b>Express.js</b>: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building robust and scalable
                        back-end applications.
                        <br>
                        <b>React</b>: A powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces on the
                        front end.
                        <br>
                        <b>Node.js</b>: A server-side runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript for
                        server-side scripting, enabling full-stack development with a single language.
                    </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I am <b>Ramsha Sultan</b>, a passionate <b>MERN Stack Development</b> student at Fast University. My journey in
                        the world of web development has been nothing short of exhilarating. With a strong foundation in
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm committed to honing my skills in both front-end and back-end
                        development.
                        <br>
                        I find joy in crafting interactive and user-friendly websites using React, and I'm fascinated by
                        the potential of Node.js on the server side. My experience with MongoDB has given me proficiency
                        in working with non-relational databases.
